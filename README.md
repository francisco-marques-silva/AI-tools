# Part 1 — Web Application (AI Screening)

## What It Does

The web application allows batch submission of scientific articles (title + abstract) for automated screening via OpenAI models. The backend processes each article and returns a screening decision (`include`, `exclude`, or `maybe`) with rationale.

## Frontend

Modern, responsive UI with:
- **Model selector** — GPT-5 family (reasoning models), GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and legacy
- **API key** input with localStorage persistence
- **Parameters** — Reasoning (verbosity, effort) for GPT-5; Temperature for chat models
- **Study context** — PICO synopsis + dynamic inclusion/exclusion criteria lists
- **Advanced Backend Settings** — Collapsible panel with:
  - **Tier selector** (Free, Tier 1–5) with auto-fill presets for all concurrency/retry fields
  - Concurrent Workers, Max/Min Concurrency, Record Max Retries, AIMD Increase After, Max API Retries, Base Backoff
  - Explanatory descriptions for each field; values persist in localStorage
- **Spreadsheet upload** — Drag-and-drop for `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv` with auto-detection of `title` and `abstract` columns
- **Real-time progress** — SSE streaming with live log, concurrency display, cancel/restart
- **Export** — Download results as CSV or XLSX

## Backend (`backend.py`)

### Technology

- **FastAPI** with CORS
- **OpenAI API** communication (GPT-4o, GPT-5 families)
- In-memory job management with thread pools
- Real-time progress via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- **Adaptive concurrency** (AIMD algorithm) — automatically adjusts parallelism based on rate-limit responses
- Export results as **CSV** and **XLSX**

### API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/start` | Start a screening job (returns `job_id`) |
| `POST` | `/api/cancel/{job_id}` | Cancel a running job |
| `GET` | `/api/status/{job_id}` | Job status (running/done/error/cancelled) |
| `GET` | `/api/progress/{job_id}` | SSE stream of real-time progress |
| `GET` | `/api/partial/{job_id}?since=N` | Partial results (paginated) |
| `GET` | `/api/errors/{job_id}` | Errors encountered during processing |
| `GET` | `/api/result/{job_id}?format=csv\|xlsx` | Final result as CSV or XLSX |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Server health check |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CONCURRENT_WORKERS` | `20` | Starting concurrent workers (AIMD initial) |
| `CONCURRENT_MAX` | `40` | Maximum concurrent workers |
| `CONCURRENT_MIN` | `2` | Minimum concurrent workers |
| `RECORD_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Per-record retry attempts on error |
| `AIUP_AFTER` | `5` | Consecutive successes before adding +1 worker |
| `OPENAI_MAX_RETRIES` | `5` | Max retries per API call (5xx errors) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_BACKOFF` | `1.0` | Base exponential backoff (seconds) |

All of the above can also be overridden **per-job** via the frontend Advanced Backend Settings panel. Values sent by the frontend take precedence over environment variables.

# Part 2 — Listfinal Filter Utility (`filter_listfinal.py`)

## What It Does

Filters `Project - Listfinal.xlsx` files by comparing against reference PDFs in `PDF/`. Removes articles that are **not** in the published included-studies list.

Uses **PyPDF2** for text extraction and applies **6 matching strategies** to handle formatting differences, OCR artifacts, and line breaks.

### Usage

```bash
# Process all projects
python filter_listfinal.py

# Process specific projects
python filter_listfinal.py mino NMDA zebra
```

### PDF ↔ Project Mapping

| Project | PDF | Expected Articles |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| mino | `list_included_studies_mino.pdf` | 28 |
| NMDA | `list_included_studies_nmda.pdf` | 264 |
| zebra | `list_included_studies_zebrafish.pdf` | 108 |

---

# Part 3 — Unified Multi-Project Report

## What It Does

Generates a **single Word document** consolidating all analyses across **all projects and models** found in the `input/` folder. The script automatically detects all files by naming convention.

## File Naming Conventions

- Articles included by humans but excluded by AI, per model and test

### 8. False Positives
- Articles excluded by humans but included by AI
- FP rate over human-excluded articles

### 9. General Comparative Table
- Consolidated view: all metrics in one table (sensitivity, specificity, F1, Kappa, fulltext capture, **Listfinal capture**, test-retest Kappa, cost)

### 10. Cost-Effectiveness

- Cost per sensitivity point

### 11. Workload Reduction Analysis
- Per-execution table comparing human time vs. AI time
- Time saved, reduction percentage, and speed factor
- Per-project summary aggregating all executions

### 12. Absolute Efficiency Analysis
- TIAB volume vs. AI positive rate vs. Listfinal capture
- Shows how much the AI reduces the screening workload while retaining relevant articles
- Efficiency score = Listfinal Capture Rate × (1 − AI Positive Rate)

### Appendices
- **Appendix A — False Positives TIAB**: title, abstract, and which models flagged as FP
- **Appendix B — Missed Fulltext Articles**: per-model matrix + detail with abstract (includes per-article × per-model miss/capture breakdown)

### Methodological Notes

Now placed at the **beginning** of the report (before Section 1) as a combined "Methodological Notes & Report Guide":
- Section-by-section guide explaining what each section contains
- Binarization: `include`/`maybe` → positive, `exclude` → negative
- Gold standard hierarchy: Listfinal > Fulltext > TIAB
- Workload reduction: based on `time_human` and `time_ia` columns
- Absolute efficiency: measures both selectivity and capture simultaneously
- Cohen's Kappa interpretation (Landis & Koch, 1977)
- Cost-effectiveness methodology

# Part 4 — External Validation Guide

This section explains how to **set up your own validation study** using this platform with your own systematic review data.

## Overview

The AI-Tools platform compares AI screening decisions against human reviewer decisions across three reference levels:

| Level | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **TIAB** | `Project - TIAB.xlsx` | Title/abstract screening decisions (primary comparison) |
| **Fulltext** | `Project - Fulltext.xlsx` | Articles selected for full-text evaluation |
| **Listfinal** | `Project - Listfinal.xlsx` | Final included articles after full-text reading (gold standard) |

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Prepare Your TIAB Spreadsheet

This is the **most important** file — it contains the human reviewer's screening decisions for every article.

**File name:** `YourProject - TIAB.xlsx`

**Required columns:**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `title` | Article title — **must match exactly** with the AI result spreadsheet |
| `abstract` | Article abstract (used for false-negative/positive analysis) |
| `decision` | Human screening decision: `include`, `exclude`, or `maybe` |

**Important:** The `title` column is the **join key** between human and AI spreadsheets. Titles must be character-for-character identical. If you exported TIABs from a reference manager (e.g., EndNote, Rayyan, Covidence), use the **exact same export** as the source for AI screening.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Fulltext Spreadsheet

Contains articles that passed TIAB screening and were selected for full-text evaluation.

**File name:** `YourProject - Fulltext.xlsx`

**Required columns:** `title`, `decision`

All articles here should have `decision = include` (they were selected for full-text reading). The report checks whether the AI would have retained these articles during TIAB screening.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Listfinal Spreadsheet

Contains the **definitive** set of included articles after full-text reading. This is the gold standard.

**File name:** `YourProject - Listfinal.xlsx`

**Required columns:** `title`, `decision`

Only articles that survived full-text evaluation should appear here. The report measures how many of these the AI would have retained — this is the most clinically relevant metric.

### Step 4: Run AI Screening

1. Start the web app: `uvicorn backend:app --port 8000`
2. Open http://localhost:8000
3. Select a model (e.g., GPT-5.2)
4. Enter your API key
5. Write your PICO synopsis and inclusion/exclusion criteria
6. Upload your TIAB spreadsheet (the one with `title` + `abstract` columns)
7. Click **Send to Backend**
8. Wait for completion, then download the result

**Naming the output:** Rename the downloaded file to match the convention:
```
YYYYMMDD - model - 1º teste - YourProject.xlsx
```

For test-retest analysis, run the same screening again and name it `2º teste`.

### Step 5: Create Metadata Spreadsheet

Create `metadata.xlsx` in the `input/` folder with one row per AI execution:

| project | code | model | parameter | version | time_ia | time_human | tokens input | tokens_output | cost_input | cost_output | cost_total |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|------------|--------------|---------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| mino | 20260227 | gpt-5-mini | reasoning=medium | 5-mini | 0:04:32 | 2:00:00 | 152340 | 28450 | 0.023 | 0.114 | 0.137 |

**Column details:**

- **`project`**: Must match the project name in your file names (case-sensitive).
- **`code`**: The YYYYMMDD prefix of your AI result file.
- **`model`**: Must match the model name in your AI result file.
- **`parameter`**: Free-text description of AI parameters used.
- **`version`**: Model version or identifier.
- **`time_ia`**: How long the AI took (format: `H:MM:SS` or `HH:MM:SS`).
- **`time_human`**: Estimated time a human would take for the same task. This is used in the **Workload Reduction** analysis (Section 11). Estimate based on average screening speed (e.g., 30 seconds per article × number of articles).
- **`tokens input` / `tokens_output`**: Token counts from the AI execution (available in the downloaded results or OpenAI dashboard).
- **`cost_input` / `cost_output` / `cost_total`**: Costs in USD (available from OpenAI usage dashboard).

### Step 6: Place All Files in `input/`

Your `input/` folder should look like:

```
input/
├── 20260227 - gpt-5-mini - 1º teste - mino.xlsx    ← AI result
├── 20260227 - gpt-5-mini - 2º teste - mino.xlsx    ← AI result (retest)
├── 20260228 - gpt-4o - 1º teste - mino.xlsx        ← AI result (different model)
├── mino - TIAB.xlsx                                  ← Human TIAB decisions
├── mino - Fulltext.xlsx                              ← Fulltext selections
├── mino - Listfinal.xlsx                             ← Final included articles
└── metadata.xlsx                                     ← Execution metadata
```

You can have **multiple projects** in the same folder. Just use different project names:

```
input/
├── ... mino files ...
├── ... zebra files ...
├── ... NMDA files ...
└── metadata.xlsx        ← Contains rows for ALL projects
```

### Step 7: Generate the Report

```bash
# Windows
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
python report/relatorio_unificado.py

# Linux / macOS
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python report/relatorio_unificado.py
```

The report is saved to `output/relatorio_unificado_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.docx`.

## Title Consistency Checklist

Title matching is critical for accurate results. Common pitfalls:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Different capitalization | Matching is case-insensitive (handled automatically) |
| Extra whitespace | Whitespace is normalized (handled automatically) |
| Different special characters (e.g., `–` vs. `-`) | Export both human and AI data from the same source file |
| Truncated titles | Ensure full titles in both spreadsheets |
| HTML entities (e.g., `&amp;`) | Clean titles before use, or ensure consistent encoding |

**Best practice:** Use the **exact same TIAB spreadsheet** as the source for both human review and AI screening. This guarantees title consistency.

## Reusing TIAB Data

The TIAB spreadsheet serves dual purposes:

1. **Source for AI screening** — Upload it to the web app (the app uses `title` + `abstract` columns)
2. **Human reference** — The `decision` column contains the human reviewer's judgment

This means you only need **one** TIAB spreadsheet per project. The AI result file will have a `screening_decision` column added by the AI, while the original TIAB keeps the human `decision`.

## Interpreting the Report

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You | Good Value |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **Sensitivity** | % of human-included articles the AI also included | ≥ 95% |
| **Specificity** | % of human-excluded articles the AI also excluded | ≥ 50% |
| **Listfinal Capture** | % of final included articles the AI retained | ≥ 95% |
| **Test-Retest Kappa** | Reproducibility of AI decisions across runs | ≥ 0.80 |
| **Workload Reduction** | Time saved using AI vs. human screening | Higher is better |
| **Efficiency Score** | Combined selectivity × capture (Section 12) | Higher is better |

### Decision Flow

```
TIAB Screening → Sensitivity/Specificity (Section 3)
       ↓
Fulltext Capture → Section 4
       ↓
Listfinal Capture → Section 5 (most important!)
       ↓
Cost-Effectiveness → Section 10
Workload Reduction → Section 11
Absolute Efficiency → Section 12
```
